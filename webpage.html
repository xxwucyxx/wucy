		<hr /> 

		<p>How’s everything?</p>

		<p>I know living in this world every single day is not easy but you’ve got what it takes to get through it for sure.

		<p>I really do hope you believe in yourself just as much as I believe in you. </p>

		<p>I just admire ppl who always go for what they believe in and like just say or share to everyone what goes through their head. 
			<br /> And that’s you! We are learning a lot from you ngl. </p>

		<p>Obviously, I am being myself right now (lol) but if you feel like nobody wants you, loves you and nobody truly 
			<br />cares about you, pls know na I could be nobody at the same damn time. I mean it. </p>

		<p>Newaysssss. Wala lang. Just think of this as a Fan love haha. Pls dont feel bad. 
			<br /> I chose to do these shts and you are not obliged to reciprocate anything :>
			<br /> I wanted to do these just to have nothing to hold against myself soon when I feel like giving up kasi for sure if
			<br /> di ko niexpress ulit what I really feel for someone, it’d take me forever ulit bago makamove on kahit crush lang yan haha.
			<br />  It took me almost 5yrs kasi bago nakamove on dun sa first crush ko in 2017 lol.</p>

		<p>Ayun lang naman. Nakita ko yung butterfly sa gilid and the moon was under the influence of daga.
			<br />Oh? Di ko rin gets. Hahahahaha ganyan ako kawalang kwentang kausap kasi idk what to say anymore.</p>
			
		<h4>I guess that’s it!!! </h4>

		<p><h4>AND OHHHH!! IT’S MY MOM’S BDAY IN HEAVEN!! SHE’D BE HAPPY IF YOU GREET HER. <br /> JUST DON’T LOOK UNDER YOUR BED AT NIGHT. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH</h4></p>
			
		<p>Btw, I tried to find some shops who sell white chocolates (someone asked you sa tiktok live mo if dark or white choco and you said white)
			<br /> pero panget naman packaging huhu. Pero main gift talaga was the zipped up jacket na fleece. 
			<br />I’ve read your tweet kasi and you said “OR” pero I couldn’t choose which one to buy kaya I bought one that has the 2 HAHAHA. </p>
			
		<p>I ordered the jacket online and di ko siya ma pin sa location ng mga kakilala ko near you kasi they’re having
			<br /> exams this week kasi bitter professors nila haha emz. So yea, I figured why not buy 
			<br /> some chocolates since Valentine’s day naman na and makikisuyo na lang din sa seller. 
			<br /> Luckily, the seller was kind enough for letting me use her location and include the jacket sa box. 
			<br /> If you haven’t seen it yet, it’s behind the shredded papers.</p>
			
		<p>Ayun lang ulit hahaha </p>
			
		<p>I guess imma stay as a fan that admires you from afar (jeez nagrhyme yun). Eh kasi naman eh.
			<br /> Just like what most ppl been saying, “Admiring you from afar is like staring at the stars; beautiful to look at, yet too hard to reach.” 
			<br /> And for sure wala ka ring idea sino ako sa dami nang naadmire sayo. ‘Wag mo na ring alamin kasi I feel like I’m being annoying already haha.</p>
			
		<p>Ayun lang ulit hahahaha last na.</p>
			
		<p>Just always remember na you are doing great everyday, you strong gal! Keep going! You got this!</p>
			
		<p>May you have a better day ahead. Ingat ka always! God bless! 😇
